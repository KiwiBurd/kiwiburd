### Welcome to somewhere.

I'm a complete amateur when it comes to programming, but I'm making things.
This definitely won't backfire 3 years into the future.

- Programs of Choice: @godotengine + @atom
- People I Work With: @AVIslashN (I'll make an account eventually), Operate Manuel, DEAD PIXEL
- Projects: EXOMEMORY, BIT.TRIP LEGACY, and a few more
